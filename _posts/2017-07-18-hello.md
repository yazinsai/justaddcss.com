Hello there! My name's Yazin, and I'm a developer. I've always wanted to get better at designing things, but could never really get around to it.

So here's my attempt at doing that &mdash; in baby steps!

Everyday, I'll plan to spend about 15 to 30 minutes learning a new lesson in design. Alot of this will, naturally, be about CSS!

I know a few things, but this'll help me practice &mdash; and hopefully, reach an adequate level before too long.

Let's get started!
